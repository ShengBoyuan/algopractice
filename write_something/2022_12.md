Sometimes your enthusiasm for work isn't rewarded. I have to say it's really frustrating. Whatever, we just need to move on. So, I think it's time to pursuit something really fun, and do something with strong aims.

Another painful day, most of the time I really wanna be in a quiet environment without disturbance. Honestly speaking, I like coding.

It seems that LeetCode doesn't have basic sorting problems. Basic sortings are really 
easy to forget, maybe I need to review them occasionally.

When I first learned these sortings as a college student, I got a particular fondness 
for Radix Sort. I was deeply impressed by its clever approach which I never thought of.
So I implement this No.10 sorting first, though it's not very popular like Quick Sort.

I have to say my knowledge foundation of algo is quite weak, many element algos are really difficult for 
me to implement. Since I graduated from high school, I got much bias against online video classes which I 
believe is too inefficient. Whatever, maybe it's time to overcome my bias and learn data structures (along 
with algos) systematically.
