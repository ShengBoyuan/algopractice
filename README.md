Sometimes your enthusiasm for work isn't rewarded. I have to say it's really frustrating. Whatever, we just need to move on. So, I think it's time to pursuit something really fun, and do something with strong aims.

Another painful day, most of the time I really wanna be in a quiet environment without disturbance. Honestly speaking, I like coding.

It seems that LeetCode doesn't have basic sorting problems. Basic sortings are really 
easy to forget, maybe I need to review them occasionally.
